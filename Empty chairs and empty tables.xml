                        <l> There's a grief that can't be spoken.</l>
                        <l> There's a pain goes on and on.</l>
                        <l> Empty chairs at empty tables</l>
                        <l> Now my friends are dead and gone.</l>

                        <l> Here they talked of revolution.</l>
                        <l> Here it was they lit the flame.</l>
                        <l> Here they sang about `tomorrow'</l>
                        <l> And tomorrow never came.</l>

                        <l> From the table in the corner</l>
                        <l> They could see a world reborn</l>
                        <l> And they rose with voices ringing</l>
                        <l> I can hear them now!</l>
                        <l> The very words that they had sung</l>
                        <l> Became their last communion</l>
                        <l> On the lonely barricade at dawn.</l>

                        <l> Oh my friends, my friends forgive me</l>


                        <l> That I live and you are gone.</l>
                        <l> There's a grief that can't be spoken.</l>
                        <l> There's a pain goes on and on.</l>

                        <l> Phantom faces at the window.</l>
                        <l> Phantom shadows on the floor.</l>
                        <l> Empty chairs at empty tables</l>
                        <l> Where my friends will meet no more.</l>


                        <l> Oh my friends, my friends, don't ask me</l>
                        <l> What your sacrifice was for</l>
                        <l> Empty chairs at empty tables</l>
                        <l> Where my friend will sing no more.</l>
